O:
Today's lesson covered several key topics. We explored interceptors, which can inject headers and handle global errors. Additionally, we successfully implemented the backend for a todo list and established connections between various components. Lastly, we delved into the basics of cloud-native technologies. <br>

R:
I feel accomplished and enriched by today's learning experience. Implementing the backend for the todo list and understanding interceptors were particularly rewarding. The introduction to cloud-native basics has sparked my curiosity for further exploration in this domain.<br>

I:
Understanding interceptors opens up possibilities for enhancing API requests by injecting headers and providing robust error handling mechanisms. The successful implementation of the todo list backend signifies progress in applying backend development skills. Learning about cloud-native fundamentals is crucial in today's tech landscape, offering insights into modern scalable and resilient application design.<br>

D:
I plan to explore advanced interceptor functionalities to optimize API interactions further. Additionally, I intend to delve deeper into cloud-native concepts, exploring containerization, orchestration, and microservices to broaden my understanding of modern application architecture. These steps will contribute to my growth as a developer and expand my knowledge in cloud-native technologies.<br>
